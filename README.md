# MTG-Token-Tracker-app
Cross Platform mobile app starting with java

The goal is to create a simple to use application that can create creature tokens for the game Magic: The Gathering. The app's primary goal is to allow the user to select a "create token" button with a drop-down list for creatures, treasure, etc.. 
  The user can then select the number of tokens they want to create for that specific token
      -For each Token on the screen, the user can select one and there will be a '+' and '-' buttons to increase or decrease the number of tokens
  The user can also name the token or select from a pregenerated list.

  FUTURE IDEA:
  Add a summoning sickness capability for newly generated tokens
